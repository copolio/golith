# Gin Bootify

Gin Bootify is a template project that aims to ease the configuration and building of a Go server-side application using
Gin. It minimizes the hassle of creating and configuring Gin applications by providing Gin middlewares, utilities,
pre-configurations, and integrations with other popular libraries written in Go.
