# Golith [WIP]

Golith is an opinionated template project that aims to ease the configuration and building of server-side
applications based on popular libraries written in Go. It aims to minimize the hassle of creating and configuring Go
applications by providing examples, middlewares, utilities, pre-configurations, and integrations with popular libraries
written in Go. It attempts to implement the Clean Architecture and the Twelve-Factor methodology in building Go-based
applications.
